    //name = ACCENT_XAL
    //description = "Zo'rane is the modern day dialect of the Zo'ra hive, composed of buzzing, cheap bisellite voice modulators that manage to sway most voices \
    into a more gender neutral tone, while retaining a distinct alien dialect. To other vaurcae, this accent is reminiscent of the authority the Zo'ra held - \
    regal and noble. Their vocal augments stereotypically have difficulty, typically when producing sounds related to the letter 's', instead substituting with \
    a harsh buzzing in the throat."
