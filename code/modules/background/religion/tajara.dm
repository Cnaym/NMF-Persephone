	description = "The second largest religion is the worship of the Snow God Mata'ke and his cohort companion gods, which dates back to ancient Tajaran times. A figure of legend, \
	Mata'ke is believed to have been the head of a hardy tribe of mountain dwellers which regularly came to the aid of other tribes which were constantly plagued by bandits and wild \
	animals. He was revered as a fierce warrior capable of fighting a platoon of men by himself, but also as a kind soul for the records of his dealings with other tribes show \
	understanding and kindness. He is upheld to be the ultimate Tajara- powerful, wise, and magnanimous. Followers of Mata'ke himself endeavor to emulate his grandeur, while others \
	attempt to emulate the other gods."
