# If you did not both _compile and run your changes_, do not make a PR! We are not here to test your experimental changes. Make sure they work on your own end first! Please indicate you both compiled and tested your code in your PR to confirm you have read this.

## Reminder: Did you set your StrongDMM editor to TGM editing mode? It will prevent conflicts from editing in the default style.

## Delete all this placeholder text after! It'll make you look silly if you don't.

* Please describe the intent of your changes, and what you did change.
* Please make sure that, in the case of mapping changes, you include images of these changes in the PR's description.
* Please make sure to mark your PR as wip or review required by making a comment with !wip or !review required

### IC changelog
_It is possible and encouraged (for changes that will have a larger impact on players) to write a ic changelog and add it to the PR description.
This changelog will be pushed to the newscasters when the PR is merged._
